        /*
        Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
        
        1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement. 
        2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'
        
        TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
        */
        
        const bill = 430;
        const tip = bill <= 300 && bill >= 50 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
        console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value ${bill + tip}`);
